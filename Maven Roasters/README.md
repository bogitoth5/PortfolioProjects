### ⛔ Dataset limitations & Challenges:

• The dataset spans from January 2023 to June 2023, limiting the ability to conduct a comprehensive seasonal analysis.<br/>
• The dataset separates  each transaction by product, making it difficult to see the actual number of customers and the amount they spent.
