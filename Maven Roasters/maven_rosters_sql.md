# **â˜• Introduction: Exploring Sales Trends at Maven Roasters**

In this exploratory data analysis (EDA), I examine sales data from Maven Roasters, a fictional cafÃ© business, over a 6-month period (Januaryâ€“June 2023). The goal is to uncover patterns and insights that can inform business decisions and help optimize performance.

This analysis focuses on three key business questions:

[**1. Sales Trends Over Time**](#-sales-trend-analysis)<br/>
How have sales evolved month to month? Are there seasonal or growth patterns that stand out?

[**2. Weekly Sales Patterns**](#-busiest-days-of-the-week-and-customer-behavior)<br/>
Which days of the week consistently attract the most customers and generate the highest sales and revenue? What patterns emerge in customer behavior?

[**3. Product Performance and Revenue Contribution**](#-product-performance-and-revenue-contribution)<br/>
Which products are the most and least popular? Which ones contribute most significantly to revenue, and what does that suggest for inventory and marketing strategy?

By answering these questions, the analysis helps paint a clear picture of how the cafÃ© is performing, what are its strengths, and where there are opportunities for growth or optimization.

<br/>

### **ðŸ“ˆ Sales Trend Analysis**

â€¢ To explore how Maven Roasters' sales have trended over time, transactional data from **January to June 2023** was analyzed. The results show a **steady upward** trend in sales, with **June** as the best performing month.<br/>
â€¢ Customer count nearly **doubled** from January to June, indicating strong growth in foot traffic and engagement.<br/>
â€¢ The total number of transactions (used to count customer visits) also **increased** significantly.<br/>
â€¢ The store achieved its **highest profit in June**, effectively doubling its profit compared to January. This shows improved efficiency or higher-value sales alongside increased traffic.<br/>
â€¢ It is important to note that transactions are counted at the item level â€” meaning that a single customer purchasing multiple items in one visit results in multiple rows with the same timestamp. This required using DISTINCT counts to accurately reflect the number of unique transactions or customers.

  COUNT(distinct transaction_time) as total_customers
FROM coffeeshop
GROUP BY month(transaction_date)

	JOIN coffeeshop_cost cc ON cs.product_detail = cc.item

### **ðŸ“Š Busiest Days of the Week and Customer Behavior**

To identify which days are the busiest for Maven Roasters and understand why, the following metrics were analyzed:<br/>

â€¢ Total number of sales<br/>
â€¢ Total revenue<br/>
â€¢ Average order value (AOV)<br/>
â€¢ Peak transaction hours<br/>
â€¢ Product category performance<br/>

The analysis revealed that **Monday, Thursday, and Friday** consistently attract the highest number of customers, and these same days also generate the most sales. This pattern suggests that customer traffic may be influenced by workweek routines, where people are more likely to grab coffee at the start and end of the workweek.


```
-- Counting transactions per day:
SELECT day, count(distinct transaction_time) as total_customers
FROM coffeeshop
GROUP BY Day
ORDER BY FIELD(day, 'MONDAY', 'TUESDAY', 'WEDNESDAY', 'THURSDAY', 'FRIDAY', 'SATURDAY', 'SUNDAY');
```

```
-- Counting sales per day
SELECT day, sum(transaction_qty) as total_sold 
FROM coffeeshop
GROUP BY Day
ORDER BY FIELD(day, 'MONDAY', 'TUESDAY', 'WEDNESDAY', 'THURSDAY', 'FRIDAY', 'SATURDAY', 'SUNDAY');
```

</p>

<br/>

ðŸ§¾ **Average Order Value Analysis**<br/>

Further analysis of average order values and product preferences by day adds context to the weekly sales patterns. The AOV remains **relatively consistent** throughout the week, suggesting stable customer spending behavior regardless of the day.

A slight increase in AOV on **Tuesdays** may point to customers purchasing higher-priced items or possibly due to a midweek promotion. In contrast, **Thursdays and Saturdays** show slightly lower average order values, which could indicate a tendency toward smaller or less expensive purchases on those days.

```
SELECT 
    DAYNAME(transaction_date) AS day_of_week, 
    CONCAT(ROUND(SUM(transaction_qty * unit_price) / COUNT(DISTINCT transaction_time),2),'$') AS avg_order_value_$
FROM coffeeshop
GROUP BY day_of_week
ORDER BY FIELD(day_of_week, 'MONDAY', 'TUESDAY', 'WEDNESDAY', 'THURSDAY', 'FRIDAY', 'SATURDAY', 'SUNDAY');
```

### **â˜• Product Performance and Revenue Contribution**

This analysis shows which products sell the most and bring in the **most revenue**, as well as which ones **sell less**. Based on these insights, the business can take actionâ€”such as promoting popular items even more or bundling them together, and reconsidering how to improve or replace the lower-selling products through special offers or changes in strategy.

To determine which products are driving performance for Maven Roasters, the following metrics were analyzed:

â€¢ Total units sold per product<br/>
â€¢ Revenue contribution per product<br/>
â€¢ Sales distribution across product categories<br/>

```
Identifying best selling items:

SELECT cs.product_category, sum(transaction_qty) as total_sold, 
	ROUND(SUM((unit_price*transaction_qty)),2) as total_revenue, 
	ROUND(SUM(cs.transaction_qty *cc.cost),1) as cost, 
    ROUND(SUM((cs.unit_price-cc.cost)*cs.transaction_qty),1) as profit
FROM coffeeshop cs
	JOIN coffeeshop_cost cc ON cs.product_detail = cc.item
GROUP BY cs.product_category
ORDER BY profit desc;
```

  <img width="386" height="184" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bogitoth5/PortfolioProjects/refs/heads/main/Maven%20Roasters/images_cafe/best_items.PNG">
</p>

```
Identifying least selling items:

SELECT cs.product_category, cs.product_detail, sum(transaction_qty) as total_sold, 
	ROUND(SUM((unit_price*transaction_qty)),2) as total_income, 
	ROUND(SUM(cs.transaction_qty *cc.cost),1) as cost, 
    ROUND(SUM((cs.unit_price-cc.cost)*cs.transaction_qty),1) as profit
FROM coffeeshop cs
	JOIN coffeeshop_cost cc ON cs.product_detail = cc.item
GROUP BY cs.product_category, cs.product_detail
ORDER BY profit
LIMIT 10;
```

```
Profit distribution per Category:

WITH CategoryProfit AS (
    SELECT 
        cs.product_category,
        ROUND(SUM((cs.transaction_qty * cs.unit_price) - (cs.transaction_qty * cc.cost)),1) AS category_profit
    FROM coffeeshop cs
    JOIN coffeeshop_cost cc ON cs.product_detail = cc.item
    GROUP BY cs.product_category
),
TotalProfit AS (
    SELECT SUM(category_profit) AS total_profit FROM CategoryProfit
)
SELECT 
    cp.product_category,
    cp.category_profit,
    ROUND((cp.category_profit / tp.total_profit) * 100, 2) AS profit_percentage
FROM CategoryProfit cp
JOIN TotalProfit tp
ORDER BY profit_percentage DESC;
```

### **ðŸ“Œ Summary & Recommendations**

**Steady Growth in Performance**<br/>

The cafÃ© showed a **consistent upward trend** in both sales volume and profit from January to June 2023, with June being the peak month. This growth may be attributed to increased customer interest or effective business strategies such as promotions or seasonal offerings. It is recommended to investigate what factors contributed to this growth to replicate success in future months.

**Key Days for Sales**<br/>

**Monday, Thursday, and Friday** emerged as the busiest days in terms of customer volume and total sales. These high-traffic days present an opportunity to further maximize revenue through **targeted campaigns**, such as limited-time offers, loyalty perks, or product bundles to encourage larger basket sizes.

**Top & Underperforming Product Categories**<br/>

Coffee, tea, drinking chocolate, and bakery items are the primary drivers of sales and revenue, which aligns with the core offerings of a cafÃ©. In contrast, packaged chocolate and loose tea show lower sales volumes. However, these items may not be truly underperforming, as they could serve a supplementary role in the product mix. Further analysis into profit margins and strategic intent would be beneficial to determine whether they are worth optimizing or maintaining as-is.
