# ‚òï Maven Roasters ‚Äì Power BI Dashboard Analysis

## üìå Project Overview
This Power BI dashboard was developed to visualize key business metrics for **Maven Roasters**, a fictional caf√©. 
The dataset contains transaction records from January to June 2023, and the goal was to discover insights about sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance.

The analysis is split across two dashboards:

A **Sales & KPI Dashboard** focused on revenue, profit, and performance over time.

A **Customer Behavior Dashboard** analyzing patterns across days of the week and product categories.

## üéØ Business Questions Answered
**1. Sales Trends Over Time**</br>
How have sales evolved from month to month? Are there any noticeable growth patterns or seasonal trends?

**2. Daily Sales Patterns**</br>
Which days consistently attract the most customers and generate the highest revenue? What insights can we gain about customer behavior?

**3. Product Performance & Revenue Contribution**</br>
Which product categories and items are driving the most revenue? Which are underutilized, and what strategic actions could be taken?

## üß≠ Dashboard Overview

The Power BI report is structured into two interactive dashboards:

**1. Sales Overview**

Focuses on monthly trends, KPIs (revenue, profit, number of transactions), and comparisons to average performance. Key visuals include:
- **Line chart** showing revenue and profit trends over time</br>
- **KPI cards** comparing monthly performance to average performance</br>
- **Bar and pie charts** highlighting most profitable categories and their contribution to total monthly profit</br>

**2. Customer Behavior**

Explores patterns across days of the week and product-level performance. Visuals include:
- Bar chart for total sales by category</br>
- Line and column chart for total customers and total sales per days of the week</br>
- Hourly distribution of sales, revenue and number of customers</br>

## üé® Design Choices & Interactivity

**Color Palette**

The dashboard uses warm shades of brown and green, reflecting the cozy and earthy aesthetic of a caf√© environment. These colors are chosen to create visual harmony while keeping the focus on key metrics and trends. 
Additionally, green is used to indicate values above average, while red highlights below-average performance, providing a quick insight into key metrics.

**Slicer Functionality**

A month slicer (January to June) allows users to filter and explore trends on a monthly level. 
While some charts display aggregated values over the entire period, the slicer enables users to see metrics for specific months for more detailed insights.

## üîç Insights & Analysis


**1. Sales Trends Over Time**
  
Between January and June, Maven Roasters showed steady growth in both sales and profit, with June being the strongest month. Monthly averages for revenue, customers, and sales were calculated to help show whether each month performed above or below average. The caf√© underperformed in the first quarter, but saw a noticeable increase starting in April. Key performance indicators (KPIs) are displayed to track total profit, customer count, and sales volume each month. The top revenue drivers were coffee, tea, and drinking chocolate.

**2. Weekly Patterns in Customer Behavior**

Although overall customer traffic is relatively balanced throughout the week, Mondays, Thursdays, and Fridays stand out with the highest number of customers and total sales. Most activity happens between 8 AM and 12 PM, indicating that visitors likely come before work or during lunchtime. Sales and foot traffic gradually decline throughout the day, reaching their lowest around 8‚Äì9 PM, close to closing time. Based on this trend, promotions during peak hours could further boost revenue, while end-of-day deals might help increase late-hour sales.

**3. Product Performance Insights**

Coffee, tea, bakery items, and drinking chocolate consistently perform the best, especially during peak hours between 8 AM and 12 PM. Coffee alone contributes around 40% of the caf√©‚Äôs total profit, making it a key revenue driver. On the other hand, items like loose tea, branded merchandise, and flavor add-ons show lower sales volume. However, since these may serve a supplementary purpose rather than being main offerings, they may not be true underperformers. Further analysis of their profitability and strategic role could help determine if any adjustments are needed.

## üîç Key Takeaways & Recommendations

**Investigate the Factors Behind Growth:**

The caf√© experienced steady sales and customer growth from January to June. Identifying the drivers of this trend ‚Äî such as promotions, new products, marketing efforts, or seasonality ‚Äî could help replicate and sustain growth.

**Optimize Peak Times with Promotions:**

Mornings (8 AM ‚Äì 12 PM) are the busiest hours with the most foot traffic. Targeted promotions during these times could maximize revenue. Additionally, offering end-of-day discounts may help boost sales during slower evening hours.

**Analyze Low-Selling Products:**

Items like loose tea and branded merchandise have lower sales. A deeper analysis of their profitability can help decide whether to promote, bundle or remove these items.

**Monitor Seasonal Patterns:**

As the current data covers only six months, ongoing monitoring could uncover seasonal trends in customer behavior. This could help the business to grow further and possibly forecast future trends.
