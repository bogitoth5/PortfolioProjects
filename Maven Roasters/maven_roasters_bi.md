# ‚òï Maven Roasters ‚Äì Power BI Dashboard Analysis

## üìå Project Overview
This Power BI dashboard was developed to visualize key business metrics for **Maven Roasters**, a fictional caf√©. 
The dataset contains transaction records from January to June 2023, and the goal was to discover insights about sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance.

The analysis is split across two dashboards:

A **Sales & KPI Dashboard** focused on revenue, profit, and performance over time.

A **Customer Behavior Dashboard** analyzing patterns across days of the week and product categories.

## üéØ Business Questions Answered
**1. Sales Trends Over Time**</br>
How have sales evolved from month to month? Are there any noticeable growth patterns or seasonal trends?

**2. Daily Sales Patterns**</br>
Which days consistently attract the most customers and generate the highest revenue? What insights can we gain about customer behavior?

**3. Product Performance & Revenue Contribution**</br>
Which product categories and items are driving the most revenue? Which are underutilized, and what strategic actions could be taken?

## üß≠ Dashboard Overview

The Power BI report is structured into two interactive dashboards:

**1. Sales Overview**

Focuses on monthly trends, KPIs (revenue, profit, number of transactions), and comparisons to average performance. Key visuals include:
- **Line chart** showing revenue and profit trends over time</br>
- **KPI cards** comparing monthly performance to average performance</br>
- **Bar and pie charts** highlighting most profitable categories and their contribution to total monthly profit</br>

**2. Customer Behavior**

Explores patterns across days of the week and product-level performance. Visuals include:
- Bar chart for total sales by category</br>
- Line and column chart for total customers and total sales per days of the week</br>
- Hourly distribution of sales, revenue and number of customers</br>

## üé® Design Choices & Interactivity

**Color Palette**

The dashboard uses warm shades of brown and green, reflecting the cozy and earthy aesthetic of a caf√© environment. These colors are chosen to create visual harmony while keeping the focus on key metrics and trends. 
Additionally, green is used to indicate values above average, while red highlights below-average performance, providing a quick insight into key metrics.

**Slicer Functionality**

A month slicer (January to June) allows users to filter and explore trends on a monthly level. 
While some charts display aggregated values over the entire period, the slicer enables users to see metrics for specific months for more detailed insights.
